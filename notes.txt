To-Do 
  You were working on handle logs and end turns and that region of stuff. You were also working on 
  buying and building 

  Next Time you are here this is what I recommend doing 
  1. Focus on getting all logs implemented, don't worry about making functions return them yet, just 
  set up the handle log function and functions you already made to handle every log in the game
  2. Then go through and design every window in the game, don't fill in any functions yet, just stub 
  in what you need for the button and drop down commands
  3. Then focus on getting rolling and landing on tiles working, implement the logs with pay taxes 
  and drawing cards. This means getting multiple logs truly working 
  4. Then get ending turns working. Implement the features needed to make jail work with what you 
  have. 
  This should keep you busy for long enough, but while I am here let me outline my ideas for 
  everything else.
  5. Then get jail working, fill in the functions you stubbed in before and make sure it all works
  6. Then get buying and building finished. Finsih the functions you have stubbed in and make sure 
  it all works
  7. If you got building done, mortgaging should be easy to do 
  8. Get trading done, the check trades will be tough, but you can get through it.
  9. Get auctioning working 
  10. Figure out what to do with Bankruptcy and ending the game
