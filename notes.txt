Place where I will keep track of notes, ideas on how to implement things, what to work on 
etc.
TO-DO:
  2. Fill in all documentation 
  3. Fill in all init functions 
  4. Fill in all getters and setters 
  5. Fill in all objects2 class functions
  6. Complete Game Start Up in retry
  7. Complete Game Drawings in retry 

New Idea for logs If a function needs to return multiple logs, have it return a list of logs
Make it so that each log can just be handled individually
  
Problem: Handle tile might call draw card, draw card might have to move the player and thus call handle tile, 
or it might move the player and not have to call handle tile(advanceToRailroad/utility makes their own logs)
Solution:
  Handle tile starts with a blank list []
  Draw Card is called, says advance to Illinois Avenue, add its text to draw cards log list -> []["Advance to Illinois Avenue"]
  Advance calls handle tile which has its own list of logs when it returns -> []["Advance to Illinois Avenue"][handleLog2]
  Concatenate all logs so the first handle tile just has one log list of logs -> ["Advance to Illinois", "Paid Rent", "buy",...]
  In handleLogList, for each log handle log 
  What this entails:
    Card functions need to return logs, maybe just return handle tile of the action 
    Need a handle log list in app 
    Functions in app call functions in game, but not the other way around, so I guess handle logs 
    will be the function and will have either take in both single and lists of logs and check or 
    only lists 


Acceptable Logs:
  Idea, make the logs tuples, (Category, Message)
  If the log is not on this list it cant be used in handle log

  Card Logs 
    (Card, "Card Text") -> Log "Card Text"

  Buying Logs
    (Buy, Not Owned) -> create window 
    (BuySuccess, "Player name" bought "tile name") -> log message as is and delete window
    (BuyFail, "Player name" doesn't have enough money to buy "tile name") -> log message as is keep window 

  Building Logs
    (BuildSuccess, "Player Name" built "number of houses" on "tile name") -> log message as is and delete window
    (BuildFail, "Player Name" doesn't have enough money to build "number of houses" on "tile name") -> log message as is
    (BuildFail, You must build on properties evenly) -> log message as is 
    (BuildSuccess, "Player Name" sold a house on "tile name") -> log message as is, delete window


  Mortgaging Logs
    (MortgageSuccess, "Player name" mortgaged "tile name" for "amount") -> log message as is, delete window 
    (MortgageSuccess, "Player name" paid "amount to unmortgage "tile name") -> log message as is, delete window 
    (MortgageInterest, "Player name" paid the interest on the mortgage of "tile name") -> log message as is(there shouldn't be a window ) 
  
  Auctioning Logs 
    (AuctionSuccess, "Player name" won "tile name" at an auction for "amount") ->  -> log message as is
    (AuctionFail, "Th")
    Created by clicking no when building, deleted by clicking accept button 
  
  Trading Logs 
    (TradeFail, "Player name" does not own "tile name") -> log message as is 
    (TradeFail, "Player name" does not have "amount") -> log message as is 
    (TradeFail, "Player name" does not have "amount" get out of jail free cards) -> log message as is
    (TradeSuccess, "Player name" traded "amount", "tiles", "number" get out of jail free cards, for
            "amount", "tiles", "number" get out of jail free cards ) -> log message as is, delete window 
  
  Jail Logs
    (Jail, "Began Turn") -> create window
    (JailFail, "Player name" rolled doubles three times) -> log message as is
    (JailFail, "Player name" is now in jail.) -> log message as is 
    (JailSuccess, "Player name" paid $50 to get out of jail) -> log message as is, delete window
    (JailSuccess, "Player name" rolled a double to get out of jail) -> log message as is, delete window
    (JailSuccess, "Player name" use a get out of jail free card)  -> log message as is, delete window 
    (JailFail, "Player name" does not have $50) -> log message as is 
    (JailFail, "Player name" does not have a get out of jail free card) -> log message as is
    (JailSuccess, "Player name" did not roll doubles and is still in jail) -> log message as is, delete window
    (JailFail, "Player name" was forced to pay $50 to get out of jail) -> log message as is
  
  Other Logs 
    (Rent, "Player name" paid "rent amount" to "other player") -> log message as is
    (Tax, "Player name" paid $100 in Luxury Tax) -> log message as is 
    (Tax, "Player name" paid $200 in Income Tax) -> log message as is
    (Roll, You rolled doubles, roll again)  -> log message as is
    (Roll, You already rolled) -> log message as is 
    (End Turn, You haven't rolled yet) -> log message as is
    (Bankruptcy, )
    (Bankruptcy, "Player name" became bankrupt and forfeited all assets to "Other Player") -> log message as is 

How Tos:
  Trading 
  Bankruptcy
    If you owe money to another player and don't have the cash open the Bankruptcy window.
    What happens is that you must sell houses at half the price and mortgage properties until you 
    have enough. If you don't then the after selling all the houses the other player gets everything
    Any mortgaged properties must have interested paid to the bank immediately
    If the money is owed to the bank, same process except the bank gets everything and auctions 
    everything
  Mortgaging
    Make sure mortgaged properties can't collect rent
    Make sure improved properties can't be mortgaged, must sell houses first
    Unmortgage at the cost of the mortgage plus 10%
    Can't have any mortgaged properties if you want to buy a house in the color group
  Jail 
    Make sure that the player can't roll if they are in jail, unless through the jail window
  Other 
    Change rolling so that if they roll doubles they can roll again 
    Make sure monopoly properties get double rent, unless there are houses
    Try to see if you can implement the build evenly rule, all properties must have 1 house before
    any can move onto two houses
    When it comes to trading, there can't be any houses on the property. Make it so you can sell 
    houses at half the price they are bought for. Must sell evenly as you bought evenly
  Start Up 
    Make a start up window that shows up before the player selection. This window should show the 
    rules to the game and will start the game by pressing a play button on the bottom of the window.
